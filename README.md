# Pairwise Sequence Alignment via Compression Algorithms

To get MT genomes for various organisms, we use the [NIH Nucleotide Search](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore) and search for "complete genome", and filter for "Mitochondrion" (using the filter "Genetic compartments" on the left). Then, we select $6$ organisms from the search results with the structure as follows: <organism> complete mitochondrial genome.
Finally, we download .FASTA files for each of the organisms which are stored in the data/ folder.

We select the following organisms for our comparisons:
- Felis catus (Cat)
- Bos taurus (Cattle)
- Euphausia pacifica (North Pacific krill)
- Damon diadema (Tailless whip scorpion or Giant Amblypygid)
- Anopheles quadrimaculatu ([A type of moscito](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Anopheles_quadrimaculatus)
- Corydalus cornutus (Eastern dobsonfly)
