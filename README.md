# Pairwise Sequence Alignment via Compression Algorithms

To get MT genomes for various organisms, we use the [NIH Nucleotide Search](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore) and search for "complete mitochondrial genome", and additionally filter for "Mitochondrion" (using the filter "Genetic compartments" on the left). Then, we select $6$ mammals from the search results with the structure as follows: <organism> complete mitochondrial genome.
Finally, we download .FASTA files for each of the organisms which are stored in the data/ folder.

We select the following mammals for our comparisons:
- Felis catus (Cat)
- Bos taurus (Cattle)
- Mus musculus (Mouse; strain Balb/cJ)
- Rattus norvegicus (Rat; wild-caught)
- Canis lupus (Wolf)
- Ovis aries (Sheep)
